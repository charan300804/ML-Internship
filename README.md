# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN

This project implements a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

## Dataset

The [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) contains images of 10 classes:
- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

Each image is a 32x32 pixel RGB image.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model used in this project consists of:
1. Two convolutional layers with ReLU activation and MaxPooling.
2. A Flatten layer to convert feature maps into a vector.
3. Fully connected layers (Dense) for classification.

**Layer Details:**
- **Conv2D:** 32 filters, kernel size (3, 3)
- **MaxPooling2D:** Pool size (2, 2)
- **Conv2D:** 64 filters, kernel size (3, 3)
- **MaxPooling2D:** Pool size (2, 2)
- **Dense Layers:** 64 neurons (ReLU) followed by the output layer with 10 neurons (logits).
